NAME
    RT::Extension::PriorityAsString - show priorities in RT as strings
    instead of numbers

SYNOPSIS
        # in RT config
        Set(@Plugins, qw(... RT::Extension::PriorityAsString ...));

        # Specify a mapping between priority strings and the internal
        # numeric representation
        Set(%PriorityAsString, (Low => 0, Medium => 50, High => 100));

        # which order to display the priority strings
        # if you don't specify this, the strings in the PriorityAsString
        # hash will be sorted and displayed
        Set(@PriorityAsStringOrder, qw(Low Medium High));

        # Uncomment if you want to apply different configurations to
        # different queues.  Each key is the name of a different queue;
        # queues which do not appear in this configuration will use RT's
        # default numeric scale.
        # This option means that %PriorityAsString is ignored (no global
        # override, you must specify a set of priorities per queue).
        # Set(%PriorityAsStringQueues,
        #    General => { Low => 0, Medium => 50, High => 100 },
        #    Binary  => { Low => 0, High => 10 },
        # );
